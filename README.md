# Listen - Background Audio Recording App

A sophisticated Android application designed to continuously record audio in the background, providing users with a rolling window of audio history for review and analysis.

## üéØ Purpose

Listen is a background-listening app that captures ambient audio from your surroundings and maintains a configurable rolling buffer of recordings. Perfect for situations where you need to review recent conversations, sounds, or audio events that occurred in the past few minutes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Continuous Background Recording**: Runs silently in the background, capturing audio 24/7
- **Configurable Segment Length**: Adjustable recording segment duration (e.g., 1 minute, 30 seconds, 5 minutes)
- **Auto Music Mode**: Intelligent segment splitting that detects natural silence breaks and targets ~5-minute segments for optimal content organization
- **Customizable Retention Period**: Set how long to keep audio history (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours)
- **Rotating Buffer System**: Automatically manages storage by deleting old segments and adding new ones
- **Instant Playback**: Access any moment from your audio history with just a few taps
- **Privacy-First Design**: All recordings stored locally on device, no cloud uploads
- **Battery Optimized**: Efficient background processing with minimal battery impact

## üîß How It Works

1. **Background Service**: The app runs a persistent background service that continuously captures audio from the device microphone
2. **Segmented Recording**: Audio is divided into user-configurable time segments (e.g., 1-minute chunks)
3. **Rotating Buffer**: When the retention period is reached, the oldest segment is automatically deleted and replaced with the newest recording
4. **Always Available**: At any moment, you have access to the complete audio history within your retention window

### Example Configurations

**Fixed Duration Mode**:
- **Segment Length**: 1 minute
- **Retention Period**: 10 minutes
- **Result**: Always have the last 10 minutes of audio available, divided into 10 one-minute segments

**Auto Music Mode**:
- **Target Duration**: ~5 minutes (adaptive)
- **Retention Period**: 30 minutes
- **Result**: Audio automatically split at natural silence breaks, typically around 5 minutes, perfect for podcasts, meetings, and music sessions

## üöÄ Use Cases

- **Meeting Review**: Check what was said in a meeting you just left
- **Conversation Recall**: Review conversations that happened while you were distracted
- **Sound Investigation**: Identify what caused a noise you heard earlier
- **Learning Aid**: Review lectures or presentations you attended
- **Podcast/Content Review**: Perfect for reviewing long-form content with auto music mode
- **Security Monitoring**: Keep an audio log of your surroundings
- **Memory Assistance**: Help with recall of recent events or conversations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **AudioRecorderService**: Background service for continuous audio capture
- **AudioSegmentManager**: Handles segment creation, rotation, and deletion
- **StorageManager**: Manages local file storage and cleanup
- **PlaybackManager**: Handles audio playback and navigation
- **SettingsManager**: User preferences and configuration

### Audio Processing
- **Format**: High-quality audio recording with configurable bitrate
- **Compression**: Efficient storage with minimal quality loss
- **Segmentation**: Precise time-based audio splitting
- **Metadata**: Timestamp and duration tracking for each segment

## üì± User Interface

- **Main Dashboard**: Overview of current recording status and available segments
- **Timeline View**: Visual representation of audio history with time markers
- **Playback Controls**: Intuitive audio player with segment navigation
- **Settings Panel**: Easy configuration of recording parameters
- **Quick Access**: Widget support for instant audio review

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All recordings remain on your device
- **No Network Access**: App doesn't require internet connection
- **Permission Control**: User grants explicit permission for microphone access
- **Data Encryption**: Optional encryption for sensitive recordings
- **Easy Deletion**: One-tap removal of all recorded data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Recording Settings
- Segment duration (15 seconds to 30 minutes)
- Auto music mode (adaptive ~5-minute segments with silence detection)
- Retention period (1 minute to 24 hours)
- Audio quality (bitrate, sample rate)
- Microphone sensitivity

### Storage Settings
- Maximum storage allocation
- Auto-cleanup thresholds
- Export options (MP3, WAV, etc.)

### Background Settings
- Battery optimization preferences
- Notification controls
- Auto-start options

## üìã Requirements

- **Android Version**: Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- **Permissions**: Microphone access, background processing
- **Storage**: Minimum 100MB free space (varies by retention settings)
- **Hardware**: Microphone support

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Build locally
- Install Android Studio (Giraffe or newer) with SDK 26‚Äì34
- Set `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`
- Build and run:
  - From IDE: Run the `app` configuration
  - CLI: `./gradlew assembleDebug`

### Logging
- Debug builds use Timber; logs routed via `AppLog` wrapper
- Release builds silence logs through `AppLog` no-op behavior

### StrictMode (debug)
- StrictMode is enabled in debug builds via `ListenApplication` to catch disk/network on main thread and leaks early

### Linting & Static Analysis
- Android Lint: `./gradlew lintDebug`
- Detekt: `./gradlew detekt`
- Ktlint: `./gradlew ktlintCheck`

### CI
- GitHub Actions builds on push/PR to `main`:
  - Assemble debug, run unit tests, Android Lint
  - Optionally runs Detekt and Ktlint if configured
